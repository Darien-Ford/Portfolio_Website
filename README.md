# ReactJS Portfolio Website
![darien-ford.com Website Thumbnail](https://darien-ford.com/assets/Screenshot-C9-Ba2QW.png)

## Introduction
This is a public repository for my portfolio website (darien-ford.com), which I built using React and Vite and currently host via Hostinger with auto-deployment using GitHub actions. This repository was created only to display the code behind the website, as the actual website is built from a private repository. 

## Technologies
- React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- Vite: Build tool for project structure and boilerplate code.
- Hostinger: Platform for web hosting with auto-deployment.
- GitHub: Platform for code management, version control, and CI/CD.
